This is an attempt to modify the original Project Pluto into a real C++ program with a modern GUI not a curses implementation.
Currently this is only C in diguise and is written in a nearly unmaintainable style.

Nonetheless the original Copyright remains with Bill Gray.

Don't use this software. It will migrate away from the original version used at the initial setup and will become practically unuseable.
Hopefully it will then one day become useable again.
